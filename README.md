This BIOS is actual only for Razer Blade 15 Advanced (2018)

| | Version |
| ---: | :--- |
| ``OpenCore`` | 0.6.1 (Beta) |
| ``Catalina`` | 10.15.6 (19G2021) |

| ``EC FW`` | 1.02 |
| ``MCU FW`` | 1.00.00.00 |

## Disclaimer
This repository has no other purpose but sharing.
I want to share my hackintosh configuration for this particular laptop with the whole world.
This is not a step by step guide, rather a thing that can greatly help you on your way of turning this or similar laptop into a hackintosh.
Though you can just grab and use this if you have same or very similar laptop model, I greatly encourage you not do so, but instead read all the things I will mention below and get some knowledge.

## Hmmm...

* Please create [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap) or `USBPort.kext` (I use Hackintool to do this) after install for best USB plug experience (uncheck SSDT-USBX-LAPTOP in config.plist or remove it when using USBMap/USBPort.kext)

* If you're using BCM9432Z Wifi card... Enable AirportBrcmFixup.kext(wifi) and all BrcmPatchRAM(bluetooth) kexts in config.plist

* Create one-key cpufriend if you often use battery, power-plug always is not recommended for best performance

Hardware Upgrades and Tools
---

The bundled ``WiFI`` and ``NVMe`` is not compatible with macOS and should be replaced. Please find below the recommended replacement parts, already tested for compatibility. Usually I need to deploy for testing 4-5 node Kubernetes cluster with at least 4Gb per node. So 32GB is a necessary upgrade for me.

macOS have native support and works better with 4k blocks. Check **NVMe format**.
Performance tested with [Blackmagic Disk Speed Test](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12). Samsung EVO 970 1Tb NVMe and Sabrent Rocket 1Tb NMVe have the same Read/Write performance. But Samsung EVO stays about 8-12Â° C hotter on heave load. Even with additional passive cooling.

**Note: I do recommend to use at least 1Tb NVMe for dual boot with Windows 10.**

## Gratitude

* [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/) - for vanilla guides
* [Acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera) - for OpenCore and lots of kexts
* [RehabMan](https://github.com/RehabMan) - for ACPI patching guides
* [Stonevil](https://github.com/stonevil) - for BIOS mod and hardware suggestions

### Where to begin

**Use stonevil's guide for modding BIOS**
* [Razer Blade Advanced early 2019 macOS 10.14/10.15 Hackintosh](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh#bios-unlock)

**Use Dortania's guide for doing config.plist and create Bootable USB**

* [OpenCore Vanilla laptop guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide)
and you must have some research then...

### Specific things

* **BIOS** You will have to change DVMT pre-alloc size to 64mb, and you can't do that via stock BIOS, please see how-to in here - [BIOS Unlock - stonevil](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh#bios-unlock)
* **GPIO pinning** There are hotpatches & ssdts that might be specific for a particular laptop, I think trackpad GPIO pinning might be one of them, please check your pin number as per - [GPI0 Pinning](https://voodooi2c.github.io/#GPIO%20Pinning/GPIO%20Pinning), and modify SSDT-I2C if needed (currently pin number is set to 0x64 in there)

---

### Todo
1. Prepare for macOS Big Sur (testing)...
2. Updated 10.15.6 with OpenCore 0.6.1...
